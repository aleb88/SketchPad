# SketchPad

Given a starting 16 by 16 grid consisting of blue squares, a user can hover the cursor over the grid, changing the color of the elements hovered over to black. 
The user can also create new grid of the same size while being able to specify how many squares it is split into, as well as create a randomly generated maze. The 
randomly generated maze uses the binary tree maze generation method.
